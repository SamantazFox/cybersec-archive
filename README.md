# cybersec-archive

This repository is meant to keep track of which cybersec-related repositories
need to be saved, should the new Github "Exploits and malware policy" be adopted.

I'll try to do my best at mirroring those (I have not unlimited storage space),
but mind that I'll mainly focus on smaller repos, which are less likely to be
already mirrored.
